# BuildView
The project considers a problem connected with digitization and visualization of three-dimensional real objects which the user wants to carry over into cyberspace. Creating, editing and visualization of models which are received by the device – Microsoft Kinect, are the main aim of “BuildView”. By using the 3D scanner the user can digitalis buildings and objects which can be processed by 3D software later. 
The project was developed by Boyan Bonev and mentored by Alexander Penev
